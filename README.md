# UnitDef
This repository contains definitions for some functions by UnitLabs. Feel free to use API on Unit!

# How to setup
### Visual Studio Code
1. Download Lua Language Server and this repo
2. Open Addon Manager (F1 -> Open: Lua Addon Manager)
3. Search and download Garry's Mod
4. Is `.vscode/settings.json` add path to this repository's `library` folder, like `D:/repos/unitdef/library/`

### I don't know for other IDEs, should be identical.

# Note
This is the first time when I use LLS docs, so there may be big changes.
